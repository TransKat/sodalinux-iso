# FAQ

### How do I use this?

**IMPORTANT: You are required to have Arch Linux or an Arch-based derivative installed in order to build this ISO file.**

First, install [archiso](https://github.com/archlinux/archiso) onto your system.

```
sudo pacman -S archiso
```

After archiso is installed, clone this repo using:

```
git clone https://github.com/sodalinux/sodalinux-iso
```

After you've cloned the repo, `cd` into the directory, and run `./build.sh` and wait a few moments.

A bunch of text will appear on screen for the remainder of the ISO building process. Don't freak out, this is just the script working its magic.

If the ISO building process at anytime stops due to an error, please open up an issue in the repo.

If all goes well, the ISO should be located in a folder called `out` which contains the ISO file. You should now have a full ISO built and ready to install.
